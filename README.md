Introduction

Getting started with smart contract programming might be daunting given how novel smart contracts are. The best way to get started is scouting the web for resources. Finding resources on smart contracts online is quite easy; however, these resources are scattered all over the web with no particular order. 

Spencer and Olsen (under the supervision of Dr. Mendes at Davidson College) decided to fix this problem by creating a curated, thorough, and progressive documentation of the smart contract space. 

In this documentation, we will take you through the most popular tools used to build and deploy smart contracts (Truffle, Ganache, Solidity), popular smart contract interfaces, and common vulnerabilities/security flaws of smart contracts.

It is important to note that this documentation was written during the Spring semester of 2022 (Smart Contract Engineering Independent Study), and certain chapters might be outdated. Please supplement our documentation with additional readings to stay up to date with smart contracts!
